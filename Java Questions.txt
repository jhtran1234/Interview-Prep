Types of memory: (https://www.javatpoint.com/corejava-interview-questions)
- Class(Method) Area: Class Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field, method data, and the code for methods.
- Heap: It is the runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects
- Stack: Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread. A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.
- Program Counter Register: PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.
- Native Method Stack: It contains all the native methods used in the application.
